# UCL CEGE Introduction to Python

This repository contains the notebooks for the UCL CEGE Introduction to Python workshop, run by Dr Tim Hillel. 

The notebooks are designed to introduce the fundamentals of coding in [Python](https://docs.python.org/3.9/), and make you familiar with three commonly used libraries:
1. [*numpy*](https://numpy.org/doc/1.23/) for handling arrays (similar to MATLAB), 
2. [*matplotlib*](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) for plotting and visualising data, and 
3. [*pandas*](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) for handling data tables (similar to Excel)

## Notebooks

The repository contains two versions of the notebooks. In the *exercises* folder, you will find versions of the notebooks with cells left blank for you to work on. The *solutions* folder then contains the completed notebooks, so you can use them if you are stuck, or as a reference after the workshop. 

## Running on your local machine

If you would like to run the notebooks on your local machine, and have not already installed Python, we would recommend installing [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

You can then launch *jupyter notebook*, either from the Anaconda user interface, or the terminal. 


## Running on browser

The notebooks can be run in your browser using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/th389/DAStudents/HEAD). 

Note, the notebooks can take a while (5 minutes) to load, so please load the link whilst you are waiting.
